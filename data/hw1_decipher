uboat commanders were trained to linger on the convoys projected line of advance at the limit of visibility until the
fall of dark then to surface if possible within the convoy columns fire salvoes from bow and sterntubes simultaneously
and to submerge and make their escapeas the escorts appeared the difficulty for the uboats was to locate a convoy in
the first place the limit of visibility at best from a conning tower was ten miles a patrol line of ten uboats could
therefore cover two hundred twenty miles of sea a convoy of fifty ships meanwhile occupied a front of only twenty four
hundred yards in the enormous spaces of the atlantic at least nine million square miles of operational waters the
one could be missed by the other with the greatest ease and usually was bad weather played apart hiding the convoys
from german eyes or forcing uboats to seek shelter from the elements at periscope depth so did routine alterations of
course and emergency turns if contact were made deliberate rerouting of convoy show ever away from patrol lines and
wolf packs located by bletchley was the most productive method david kahn the great historian of cryptography gives a
dramatic account of one such rerouting contest in his book on the uboat wars eizing the enigma this passage excerpted
